-	###	What is Software Engineering?
	Software Engineering is a systematic, disciplined, and quantifiable approach to the development, operation, and maintenance of software. It encompasses a collection of methodologies, tools, and techniques used to create high-quality software in a cost-effective and timely manner. The primary goal is to manage the complexity of software development and ensure the resulting software meets user requirements and is reliable, efficient, and maintainable.

-	### How Does it  Differ from Traditional Programming:
	-	**Scope:** Traditional programming focuses on writing code to solve specific problems. Software engineering involves a broader scope including requirements gathering, design, development, testing, deployment, and maintenance.

	-	**Process:** Software engineering follows a structured process or methodology (such as SDLC) to manage the software development lifecycle, whereas traditional programming may lack this formal structure.

	-	**Collaboration:** Software engineering often involves teams of developers, designers, testers, and other stakeholders. Traditional programming might be an individual activity.

	-	**Maintenance and Evolution:** Software engineering emphasizes long-term maintenance and evolution of software, while traditional programming may not consider future changes or updates.

-	### Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC): Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
	The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) consists of several phases that provide a framework for planning and controlling the creation, testing, and deployment of software systems. The primary phases include:

	-	**Requirement Analysis:** Gathering and documenting the functional and non-functional requirements of the software from stakeholders and understanding what the software should do and the constraints within which it must operate.

	-	**System Design:** Translating requirements into a blueprint for constructing the software.and dividing into high-level design (architecture) and low-level design (detailed design of components).

	-	**Implementation (Coding):** Writing the actual code based on the design documents and developers building the software modules and integrating them.

	-	**Testing:** Verifying that the software meets the requirements and identifying any defects.This involves various levels of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance testing).

	-	**Deployment:** Releasing the software to the production environment where it can be used by the end-users.This includes activities such as installation, configuration, and user training.

	-	**Maintenance:** Ongoing support for the software after it is deployed. This involves correcting defects, making enhancements, and optimizing performance.
