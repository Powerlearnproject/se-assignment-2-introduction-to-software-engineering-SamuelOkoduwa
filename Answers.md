-	###	What is Software Engineering?
	Software Engineering is a systematic, disciplined, and quantifiable approach to the development, operation, and maintenance of software. It encompasses a collection of methodologies, tools, and techniques used to create high-quality software in a cost-effective and timely manner. The primary goal is to manage the complexity of software development and ensure the resulting software meets user requirements and is reliable, efficient, and maintainable.

-	### How Does it  Differ from Traditional Programming:
	-	**Scope:** Traditional programming focuses on writing code to solve specific problems. Software engineering involves a broader scope including requirements gathering, design, development, testing, deployment, and maintenance.

	-	**Process:** Software engineering follows a structured process or methodology (such as SDLC) to manage the software development lifecycle, whereas traditional programming may lack this formal structure.

	-	**Collaboration:** Software engineering often involves teams of developers, designers, testers, and other stakeholders. Traditional programming might be an individual activity.

	-	**Maintenance and Evolution:** Software engineering emphasizes long-term maintenance and evolution of software, while traditional programming may not consider future changes or updates.

-	### Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC): Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
	The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) consists of several phases that provide a framework for planning and controlling the creation, testing, and deployment of software systems. The primary phases include:

	-	**Requirement Analysis:** Gathering and documenting the functional and non-functional requirements of the software from stakeholders and understanding what the software should do and the constraints within which it must operate.

	-	**System Design:** Translating requirements into a blueprint for constructing the software.and dividing into high-level design (architecture) and low-level design (detailed design of components).

	-	**Implementation (Coding):** Writing the actual code based on the design documents and developers building the software modules and integrating them.

	-	**Testing:** Verifying that the software meets the requirements and identifying any defects.This involves various levels of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance testing).

	-	**Deployment:** Releasing the software to the production environment where it can be used by the end-users.This includes activities such as installation, configuration, and user training.

	-	**Maintenance:** Ongoing support for the software after it is deployed. This involves correcting defects, making enhancements, and optimizing performance.

-	###	Agile vs. Waterfall Models: Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?
	-	**Waterfall Model:**
		**Sequential Process:** It follows a linear and sequential approach where each phase must be completed before moving to the next.
		**Documentation-Driven:** The waterfall model emphasizes comprehensive documentation at each phase.	
		**Change Management:** Changes are difficult and costly once a phase is completed.
		**Preferred Scenero:** It is suitable for projects with well-defined requirements and low uncertainty, such as governmental or industrial software.

	-	**Agile Model:**
		**Iterative Process:** This involves iterative and incremental development cycles called sprints.
		**Collaboration-Driven:** It emphasizes collaboration and communication among team members and stakeholders.
		**Flexibility:** Easily accommodates changes and evolving requirements.
		**Preferred Scenero:** Ideal for projects with high uncertainty, rapidly changing requirements, and where customer feedback is crucial, such as web and mobile applications.

	**Contrast between Water Fall and Agile:**
	**Process Approach:** Waterfall is linear, Agile is iterative.
	**Flexibility:** Waterfall is rigid, Agile is flexible.
	**Customer Involvement:** Waterfall has limited customer interaction after requirements are set, Agile involves continuous customer feedback.
	**Risk Management:** Waterfall handles risk at each phase completion, Agile addresses risk continuously through iterative cycles.

-	 ### Requirements Engineering: What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
	Requirements Engineering is the process of defining, documenting, and maintaining the requirements for a software system. It involves a set of activities aimed at understanding what the stakeholders need and ensuring that the software meets those needs.
-	The Process involves the following:

	-	**Elicitation:** Gathering requirements from stakeholders through interviews, surveys, observations, and workshops.
	-	**Analysis:** Analyzing the gathered requirements to ensure they are clear, complete, and feasible.
	-	**Specification:** Documenting the requirements in a detailed and unambiguous manner, often in a Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document.
	-	**Validation:** Ensuring the documented requirements accurately reflect the stakeholders' needs and are feasible to implement.
	-	**Management:** Managing changes to the requirements as the project progresses and ensuring traceability throughout the development lifecycle.

-	**The Importance:**

	-	**Foundation:** Provides a clear understanding of what the software should do, forming the foundation for design, development, and testing.
	-	**Alignment:** Ensures all stakeholders have a shared understanding of the requirements, aligning expectations.
	-	**Quality Assurance:** Helps in identifying potential issues early in the development process, reducing the cost of changes and rework.
	-	Scope Management: Prevents scope creep by managing and controlling changes to the requirements.
